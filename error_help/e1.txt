Unexpected end of file

The compiler was expecting something like a ' or " or } or ) or ]

Take the following example:-

    Code:
    def main():
        a='bad code

    Error:
    Missing ' at eof. A symbol if started has to have a closing parameter. The same condition applies to dictionary,list,Cppcode etc.
    
    Correction:
    def main():
        a='bad code'
