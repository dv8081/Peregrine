Error #3: Class contains something other than variables, methods, nested class/union or enum.

A class can only contain variable or methods or nested class/union or enum.

Example:
    class iterate_test:
        int <variable_name> = 0;
    
        class <nested_class>:
            [Your code here]
        
        enum <nested_enum>:
            a,b,c
        
        union <nested_union>:
            x:int
            y:float
        
        def __init__(self,c):
            [Your code here]
            
In the above example:
1. Text written between <> is changeable as per requirement.
2. Code goes between [].
