Error #4: Virtual function cannot be declared outside the class.

A virtual function can only be declared inside a class.

Example:
    class <name>:
        virtual __init__(self):
            [Your code here]
            
In the above example:
1. Text written between <> is changeable as per requirement.
2. Code goes between [].
